  <p><i>HeavyMetL</i> is an in-browser software package for determination of relative abundance and label incorporation in <sup>15</sup>N-labelled samples analysed by Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry, enabling graphical analysis of <sup>15</sup>N data without the necessity for command-line interaction.</p>
  <p>The quantification algorithm is an iteration on several approaches that have been previously described for <sup>15</sup>N, with improved signal-to-noise handling and basic handling for sample-to-sample chromatographic differences.</p>
  <p>Processing is performed locally using a multi-threaded JavaScript WebWorker model.  The page itself may be saved locally for offline processing and to make permanent edits to the configuration files.</p>
  <p>The latest version of the software is available <a href="HeavyMetL.htm">here</a></p>
  <br />
  <p>The code is publicly available in two repositories:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The quantification software: <a href="https://github.com/pdcharles/HeavyMetL">HeavyMetL</a> 
   <li>A library of general MS-related js code: <a href="https://github.com/pdcharles/MSLIB">MSLIB</a> 
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p>HeavyMetL inital development was undertaken at the <a href="https://proteomics.bio.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge Centre for Proteomics</a> funded by a BBSRC PhD Grant at the University of Cambridge, UK.  This code is distributed under the MIT License.</p>
